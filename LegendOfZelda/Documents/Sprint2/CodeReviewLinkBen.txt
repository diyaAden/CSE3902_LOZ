Reviewing the Link interfaces and classes

/*
 *  Overall Review
*/
- Overall I really like the abstraction and the design of the Link stuff. 
    - It allows for additions to the link classes and easy changes between sprites.

- The general format for chagning the link character is:
1. Input from the user.
2. Command to act upon the link state. 
3. A new state is made upon the basic link state.
4. Then the sprite is drawn to the screen from the sprite classes.

Most of the code is similar so I will look into a few specific files to add more feedback.

BasicLinkState.cs 
1. This has good readability with clear variable names.
2. I could understand where each method was to change link and how they changed what sprite. 
3. One thing you could change is change the direction to an enum.

FrontAttackLinkState.cs
1. This class is maintainable and could have more things to change such as changing links color. 
2. Link will have a lot more of these sprite changes so having them all in a folder is good. 
3. Adding another folder for speical link states might be beneficial for the future as we add those.

- The Link class will need a lot more moving forward in terms of handling health, items, and more.
- Will that be handled in the link class or the basic link class? Or a whole different class?
