Comments:
	- I think overall, this file is very readable.
	- Author does a good job of defining variables in the constuctor.
	- Really my only recommendations are adding comments to describe what the constructor does.
	- Maybe set the integers to variables to make it easier to change, but in this case honestly it would just add more work, while only slightly increasing readabbility.

There isn't a whole lot going on in the file since most of it is just a basic constructor, but I think Sean did a good job of keeping organzied and maintaining readablility.
