	-This file is kind of simple as in it does not do too much, but the part of the class that deals with a collision with a wall master could be simplified more by maybe offloading a lot of the functionality into the link class.
	-This file could be made more readable since there are a lot of magic numbers and verious values throughout the class that make it harder to understand and follow. Using variables with good names could make it better.
	-This file seems like it would be maintainable since finding a bug or error should be easy due to the exact purpose of each line of code and if statement.
	-This file is not very reusable since it is almost completely dependant on the link class for a lot of its implementation.
