Comments:
	- The file is really readable.
	- There are readable variables, maybe could explain little for lastHeart and firstEmpty.
	- Maybe DamageLink() could be changed to LinkBeDamaged or LinkLoseHeart, since there is GainHeart next I vote for LoseHeart.

The whole script is really neat and easy to follow.
