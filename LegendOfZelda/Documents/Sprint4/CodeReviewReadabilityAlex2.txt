Comments:
	- I think overall, this file is very readable.
	- Author does a good job of defining variables at the top of the file, along with constant ints being initialized.
	- Really my only recommendations are adding comments to describe the switch statement.
	- It looks like some magic numbers are in the file, but for a specific reason so it doesnt hurt having them. 
	- The class seems complicated but Diya does a good job of making sure everything is organized.

This file is obviously dealing with the sprites within the HUD, and I think Diya did a great job of making sure to keep things organized and readable.
