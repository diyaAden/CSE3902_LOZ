Comments:
	- The class is fairly short, so it is pretty easy to follow along with.
	- I see he creates basic variables at the top, and then creates a switch for each room.
	- We then have a list of methods that creates each room, which is done using encapsulation.

I think the code quality in the file meets the standard of what high quality code is. It's easy to follow along with and consice and efficient.
