Comments: 
	-This class is extremely readable. Everything has a very clear name that indicates what it is and does.
	-The use of white space also increases the readability, even though the file is very short and simple.
	-Since all of the work is sent to the link class, it is very easy to see where the work is done.

Hypothetical Change: If something else were needed to happen as a result of the player colliding with the enemy, such as the enemy being pushed back, I feel that this class could easily support the change since all of the work for link is currently handled within the link class. The effect on the enemy could be implemented to take place within the enemy class and simply adding another line into this class.
