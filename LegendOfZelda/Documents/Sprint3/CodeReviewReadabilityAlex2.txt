Comments:
	- I think overall, this file is very readable.
	- Author does a good job of defining variables in the constuctor.
	- Really my only recommendations are adding comments to describe the switch statement.
	- The rest is just defining basic methods but not much you can do to make it more readable, other than maybe adding a comment or two.

There isn't a whole lot going on in the file since most of it is just defining basic methods for drawing rooms, but I think Ben did a good job of keeping organzied and maintaining readablility.
