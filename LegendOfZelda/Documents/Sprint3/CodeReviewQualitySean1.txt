Comments: 
	-The file is extremely simple, almost to the point to where it seems almost unneeded in the project since all it does it call a method within another class.
	-Due to its simplicity, it is extremely readable and easy to follow.
	-It seems rather maintainable since any new functionality would likely be added into the Link method and there is essentially no way for this class specifically to break down unless something is changed in the Link class.
	-This class does not seem very reusable since it is very dependant on the existance of the Link class, as well as the Enemy class and the sides of the collision boxes.
