RoomManager.cs (Author: Sean Burns)
Time Spent: 10min
Comments:
	- Really easy to follows the script, and easy to use/change the current room data outside like Game.cs in game.
	- Great connection with xml files.
	- Maybe we could remove load functions to a script focus on loading.
	
I think the code quality is really good. And it is easy to add more features.
