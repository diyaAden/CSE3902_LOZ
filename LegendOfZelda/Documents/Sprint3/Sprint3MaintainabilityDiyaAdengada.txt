Sprint number: 3
Name of the file being reviewed: room7.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Alex Q. 
Specific comments on code quality:
* The quality of this class is also very clean. The file is long, but this seems unavoidable as there needs to be a block for each item, and there’s a set number of items in each room. 
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
* A hypothetical change might be including some way to reduce the amount of blocks, like for a group of blocks in a specific pattern, maybe they could be grouped together as a certain object to make this file a little shorter. The code would be able to support this change pretty easily.
