Comments:
	- This is where a lot of the logic is happening behind the scenes so this is a super important class.
	- I like checking if the side is empty first this helps the game keep going.
	- The left and right check could be zero so check for that.
	- Overall this code works really well, just takes a lot of logic to check for collision.
