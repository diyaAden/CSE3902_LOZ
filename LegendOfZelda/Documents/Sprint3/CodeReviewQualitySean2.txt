	-The file seems complex at first glance, but actually seems quite simple. The most complex part of this entire class seems to be selecting which side to add to the list to return.
	-The file is very readable since all of the values used have very clear names on what they are. The only possible confusion is the use of the name 'CheckSide' which is the intersection rectangle. I feel this name is not very clear on what it is.
	-This file seems quite maintainable since it would be very easy where the problem is if something was wrong with finding the side of the collision. I also feel that it would be easy to "fine-tune" this class if the functionality needed to slightly change.
	-This file seems very reusable due to its ability to determine which side of the target object the player touched. With some small modifications, I believe this file could be the only one used for doing this job in the entire program.
