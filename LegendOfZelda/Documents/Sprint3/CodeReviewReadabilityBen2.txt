CollisionPlayerGameObjectDetector.cs (Author: Jiayi)
Time Spent: 10min
Comments:
	- First thing that jumps out is that the handlers are named "PlayerGameObjectCollisionHandler" while the detector is named "CollisionPlayerGameObjectDetector"
	- Renaming this file to "PlayerGameObjectCollisionDetector" a slight difference but keeps it in the same format.
	- More overloading of methods is good, however two methods return null with no explanation? 
	- Some else if statements could be changed to else, but not super necessary.
