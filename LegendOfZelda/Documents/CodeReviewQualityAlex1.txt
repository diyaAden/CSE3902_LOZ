Comments:
	- The class is fairly short, so it is pretty easy to follow along with.
	- I can quickly see that we create some basic variables at the top which is good.
	- The abstract update method is present.
	- The draw method is the same as what we've done in class and is easily recognizable.

I think the code quality in the file meets the standard of what high quality code is. It's easy to follow along with and consice and efficient.
