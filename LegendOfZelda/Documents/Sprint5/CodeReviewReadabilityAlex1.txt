Comments:
	- I think overall, this file is very readable.
	- Author does a good job of defining variables at the top.
	- Really my only recommendations are adding comments to describe certain sections of code.
	- Maybe give a brief description of what the file is doing overall, or justify the pattern of code we see.

There isn't a whole lot going on in the file since most it is really just drawing and naming the avhievements but I think Jiayi did a good job of keeping organzied and maintaining readablility.
