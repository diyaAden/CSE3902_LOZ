Specific comments on code quality:
* Overall, the quality of this code was very good. The code was easy to read, was well formatted, and most of the names were easy to understand. The only comment I have regarding this is that a lot of variables and functions for the Player state have very similar names, like for the cloud state, the variable is just called state, for example. We could rename this to something like “cloudState” just to further emphasize which specific enemy it is representing. Same for the functions: the functions could be slightly renamed to something like “enemyMoveUp()” or “cloudMoveUp()”. In terms of length, this class is only about 50 lines (likely less), so I think the code has been well compartmentalized.


* A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
   * Some changes we might make in the future might be the addition of increased functionality to the enemy’s methods. For example, we want the enemy to be able to attack the player and actually cause damage to them. For this change, the current implementation would easily support this change, as it would only require adding on to an existing method.
