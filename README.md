Player Controls
- Arrow and "wasd" keys move Link and change his facing direction.
- The 'z' and 'n' key cause Link to attack using his sword.
- Number keys (1, 2, 3, etc.) are used to let Link use a different item
- Use 'e' to cause Link to become damaged.

Block/obstacle controls
- Use keys "t" and "y" to cycle between which block is currently being shown

Item Controls
- Use keys "u" and "i" to cycle between which item is currently being shown
- Items move and animate, but don't interact with any other objects

Enemy/NPC (other character) Controls
- Use keys "o" and "p" to cycle between which enemy or npc is currently being shown (i.e. think of these characters as being in a list where the game's current character is being drawn, "o" switches to the previous item and "p" switches to the next)
characters do not interact with any other objects as of now

Other Controls
- Use 'q' to quit and 'r' to reset the program back to its initial state.


Updates Log:
Sprint 2 Completion 2/21/22

Potential Bugs:
- Switching Link to "damage" state might take a couple of presses to go into effect due to how fast the damage state is toggled
- Current NPC movement is very fast and largely based on randomness, a more controlled system will be utilized in the future
